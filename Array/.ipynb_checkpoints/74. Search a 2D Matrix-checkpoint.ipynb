    "If we flatten the given 2D matrix to a 1D array, the 1D array will also be sorted. By utilizing binary search on this sorted 1D array to locate the 'target' element, we can further decrease the time complexity. The flattening will be like the following:\n",

    "But if we really try to flatten the 2D matrix, it will take O(N x M) time complexity and extra space to store the 1D array. In that case, it will not be the optimal solution anymore.\n",

    "If we can figure out how to convert the index of the 1D array into the corresponding cell number in the 2D matrix, our task will be complete. In this scenario, we will use the binary search with the indices of the imaginary 1D array, ranging from 0 to (NxM)-1(total no. of elements in the 1D array = NxM). When comparing elements, we will convert the index to the cell number and retrieve the element. Thus we can apply binary search in the imaginary 1D array.\n",
